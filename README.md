## A Bit More About Me 🌱

I'm currently focused on projects using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. My first year at Noroff has been an incredible journey of growth, challenges, and lots of coding! I'm located in the beautiful country of Spain, enjoying its rich culture and sunny weather while I dive deep into the world of front-end development.

I'm all about doing things well and with care. I believe in putting effort and thought into every line of code I write, ensuring not just functionality, but also usability and aesthetics. 

As I look forward to my second year, I'm excited about the new technologies and projects I'll be exploring. Keep an eye out for some exciting stuff coming up!
